<p id="description">This project is a web application designed with a modern and secure user authentication system. The frontend is built using React and styled with the Material-UI (MUI) framework ensuring a clean responsive and visually appealing user interface. Key Features: Registration with OTP Verification: Users can register by providing their email address which is verified through a One-Time Password (OTP) sent to their email. This ensures that only valid email addresses are registered in the system. Sign-In with Secure Authentication: The application employs JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication. Upon successful login a JWT is issued allowing users to access protected routes and features within the application. This method provides a secure and scalable way to manage user sessions. Hosting: The frontend of the application is hosted on Vercel providing a fast reliable and scalable platform for deployment. Vercel also ensures continuous integration and delivery making it easier to maintain and update the application.</p>

<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   User Registration with OTP Verification: Users can register by entering their email address and other necessary details. An OTP is sent to the user's email for verification ensuring the authenticity of the provided email address. The OTP verification process adds a layer of security and helps prevent the use of invalid or fake email addresses.
*   Secure Sign-In with JWT Authentication: After successful registration users can sign in using their credentials. The application uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication ensuring that user sessions are secure and tamper-proof. JWT tokens are stored securely and used for accessing protected routes within the application.
*   Responsive and User-Friendly Interface: The frontend is designed with Material-UI (MUI) providing a consistent and aesthetically pleasing user interface. The application is fully responsive ensuring a seamless experience across different devices including desktops tablets and smartphones.
*   Scalable Hosting on Vercel: The application is hosted on Vercel which provides a scalable and reliable hosting environment. Vercel offers features like automatic scaling continuous deployment and global CDN ensuring optimal performance and uptime.
